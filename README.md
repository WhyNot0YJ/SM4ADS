![image-20231229134818540](public/image-20231229134818540.png)

## Project Overview

SM4ADS is a specialized graphical modeling tool developed for the field of autonomous driving systems. It utilizes the SysML (System Modeling Language) for modeling purposes. This tool primarily extends five types of diagrams:

- Requirement Diagram
- Block Definition Diagram
- Internal Block Definition
- Activity Diagram
- State Machine Diagram

The tool aims to assist developers and engineers in modeling and designing autonomous driving systems more efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Requirement Diagram:** Describes system requirements and specifications.
- **Block Definition Diagram:** Defines various modules in the system and their relationships.
- **Internal Block Definition:** Illustrates the structure and interaction of internal modules in the system.
- **Activity Diagram:** Displays the behavior of various operations and processes in the system.
- **State Machine Diagram:** Describes state transitions of modules or objects within the system.

## Installation and Usage

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the project locally: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/SM4ADS.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd SM4ADS`

### Usage Instructions

This project is built using Vue 3. Before starting the project, ensure your computer has a recent version of Node.js installed. Then follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the command `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies for the project.

2. **Run the Project**: After the installation is complete, start the project by running `npm run dev`. This command will start the development server, and you can view the project in your browser by visiting `http://localhost:5173` (or a different port specified in the terminal).

3. **Production Build**: To build the project for production deployment, use the command `npm run build`. This will generate optimized files in the `dist` directory.

Make sure to review the `package.json` file for additional available scripts or configurations related to the project.
